  <h1>State Legislature: Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council</h1>
  <p>
    The *State Legislature* in India may be *unicameral* (only Legislative Assembly) or *bicameral* (Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council). The provisions related to state legislatures are detailed in *Part VI (Articles 168–212)* of the Indian Constitution.
  </p>

  <h2>Article 168: Composition of State Legislatures</h2>
  <p>
    Each state shall have a legislature consisting of the Governor and either one house (Legislative Assembly) or two houses (Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Legislative Assembly (Vidhan Sabha)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Article 170:</strong> Composition - Members are directly elected by the people.</li>
    <li><strong>Strength:</strong> Varies by state; minimum 60 and maximum 500 members.</li>
    <li><strong>Term:</strong> 5 years unless dissolved earlier.</li>
    <li><strong>Presiding Officer:</strong> Speaker and Deputy Speaker.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Powers and Functions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Has full legislative powers for state subjects (State List and Concurrent List).</li>
    <li>Can introduce and pass money bills (Article 198).</li>
    <li>Controls the state executive through no-confidence motions, discussions, and questions.</li>
    <li>Approves the state budget and financial bills.</li>
    <li>Participates in electing the President of India.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. Legislative Council (Vidhan Parishad)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Article 171:</strong> Composition - Members are partly elected and partly nominated.</li>
    <li><strong>Tenure:</strong> Permanent body; one-third of its members retire every 2 years.</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum Strength:</strong> Cannot exceed one-third of the strength of the Legislative Assembly, and in no case less than 40 members.</li>
    <li><strong>Presiding Officer:</strong> Chairman and Deputy Chairman.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Powers and Functions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Acts as a revising chamber; can delay ordinary bills but not reject them.</li>
    <li>Cannot initiate or amend money bills (Article 198).</li>
    <li>Can discuss matters of public interest and influence legislation through recommendations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Comparison: Legislative Assembly vs Legislative Council</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Legislative Assembly</strong> holds more powers, especially financial and executive control.</li>
    <li><strong>Legislative Council</strong> has advisory and revising powers but limited authority.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Creation and Abolition</h2>
  <p><strong>Article 169:</strong> Parliament may create or abolish Legislative Councils in states by law if the Legislative Assembly of the state passes a resolution by a special majority.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The structure of state legislatures reflects federal principles and gives states the flexibility to adopt a unicameral or bicameral system. The Legislative Assembly plays a dominant role in state governance, while the Legislative Council supports with deliberation and expertise.
