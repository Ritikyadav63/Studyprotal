  <h1>Democracy – Concept, Types, Features, and Challenges</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Democracy is a form of government where power is vested in the hands of the people. It emphasizes participation, equality, 
    freedom, and accountability. The idea of democracy has evolved over centuries from direct to modern representative systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Definitions by Thinkers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Abraham Lincoln:</strong> “Democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people.”</li>
    <li><strong>J.S. Mill:</strong> Democracy promotes individual liberty and political education.</li>
    <li><strong>Robert Dahl:</strong> Democracy is characterized by polyarchy—pluralism, participation, and competition.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Types of Democracy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Direct Democracy:</strong> People make decisions directly (e.g., ancient Athens).</li>
    <li><strong>Representative Democracy:</strong> People elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf.</li>
    <li><strong>Liberal Democracy:</strong> Based on free and fair elections, rule of law, and protection of rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Participatory Democracy:</strong> Focuses on broad participation in decision-making beyond elections.</li>
    <li><strong>Deliberative Democracy:</strong> Emphasizes discussion and reasoning in public decision-making.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Core Principles of Democracy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Popular Sovereignty</li>
    <li>Political Equality</li>
    <li>Rule of Law</li>
    <li>Majority Rule and Minority Rights</li>
    <li>Free and Fair Elections</li>
    <li>Separation of Powers</li>
    <li>Protection of Fundamental Rights</li>
    <li>Accountability and Transparency</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Democracy in the Indian Context</h2>
  <p>
    India is the world's largest democracy, with a parliamentary system and a written constitution. The Constitution ensures democratic governance, 
    fundamental rights, and free elections.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Preamble:</strong> Declares India as a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.</li>
    <li><strong>Articles 324–329:</strong> Provide for an independent Election Commission and electoral process.</li>
    <li><strong>Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles:</strong> Promote liberty, equality, and justice.</li>
    <li><strong>Democratic Institutions:</strong> Parliament, State Assemblies, Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRI).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Importance of Democracy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensures participation of people in governance</li>
    <li>Protects individual rights and freedoms</li>
    <li>Promotes equality and social justice</li>
    <li>Holds government accountable to the people</li>
    <li>Peaceful transfer of power and political stability</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges to Democracy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Corruption and misuse of power</li>
    <li>Voter apathy and low political awareness</li>
    <li>Communalism, casteism, and identity politics</li>
    <li>Fake news and political polarization</li>
    <li>Undue influence of money and muscle power</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Democracy vs. Other Systems</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Democracy vs. Monarchy:</strong> In democracy, rulers are elected; in monarchy, power is inherited.</li>
    <li><strong>Democracy vs. Dictatorship:</strong> Democracy ensures freedom and participation; dictatorship is authoritarian.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Democracy is not merely a system of government but a way of life based on freedom, dignity, and collective decision-making. 
    For democracy to thrive, it requires an active citizenry, strong institutions, and continuous vigilance against threats to liberty and justice.
