  <h1>System of Government</h1>

  <h2>I. Parliamentary System</h2>
  <p>
    India follows the *Parliamentary system* where the executive is responsible to the legislature and derives its authority from it.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Collective Responsibility:</strong> Article 75(3) – The Council of Ministers is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha.</li>
    <li><strong>President as Nominal Head:</strong> Article 74 – There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President.</li>
    <li><strong>Prime Minister as Real Executive:</strong> De facto authority lies with the PM and the cabinet.</li>
    <li><strong>Vote of No Confidence:</strong> If the Lok Sabha passes a no-confidence motion, the government must resign.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples:</h3>
  <p>India, United Kingdom, Japan</p>

  <h2>II. Presidential System</h2>
  <p>
    In the *Presidential system*, the executive is independent of the legislature and holds fixed tenure.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>President is both Head of State and Government.</li>
    <li>Fixed term of office and separation of powers.</li>
    <li>Not accountable to the legislature for day-to-day functioning.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> United States, Brazil, Nigeria</p>

  <h2>III. Unitary System</h2>
  <p>
    A *Unitary system* has a single center of power. The central government holds supreme authority, and local governments operate under its control.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>No constitutional division of powers between center and units.</li>
    <li>Local authorities are subordinate.</li>
    <li>Uniform administration and laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Examples:</strong> United Kingdom, China, France</p>

  <h2>IV. Federal System</h2>
  <p>
    A *Federal system* constitutionally divides power between the central and state governments. Both operate independently.
  </p>

  <h3>Federal Features in India:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Dual Polity:</strong> Centre and States (Article 1 – India that is Bharat, a Union of States).</li>
    <li><strong>Distribution of Powers:</strong> Article 246 – Three lists: Union, State, Concurrent (Seventh Schedule).</li>
    <li><strong>Written Constitution:</strong> Provides clarity on power distribution.</li>
    <li><strong>Supremacy of Constitution:</strong> All laws must conform to the Constitution.</li>
    <li><strong>Independent Judiciary:</strong> Article 124 – Establishment of Supreme Court; role in federal disputes (Article 131).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Unitary Features in Indian Federalism:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strong Centre:</strong> More subjects in Union List, residuary powers with Centre (Article 248).</li>
    <li><strong>Emergency Powers:</strong> Centre can take full control during emergency (Articles 352, 356).</li>
    <li><strong>Single Constitution and Citizenship:</strong> Articles 5–11 (citizenship), single constitution for both Centre and States.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>India is described as a “quasi-federal” state with a strong unitary bias.</strong></p>
