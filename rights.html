  <h1>Rights – Meaning, Types, Theories, and Importance</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement. They are essential for individuals to live 
    with dignity, participate in society, and protect their liberty and equality. Rights form the foundation of democracy and rule of law.
  </p>

  <h2>Definitions by Thinkers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Laski:</strong> "Rights are those conditions of social life without which no man can seek to be himself at his best."</li>
    <li><strong>Hobhouse:</strong> "Rights are what we consider necessary for the common good of society."</li>
    <li><strong>Green:</strong> Rights are powers necessary for the fulfillment of man’s moral being.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Types of Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Natural Rights:</strong> Inherent to all humans by birth, such as life, liberty, and property.</li>
    <li><strong>Moral Rights:</strong> Based on conscience and ethics, not always enforceable by law.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Rights:</strong> Recognized and enforced by the law of the state.</li>
    <li><strong>Civil Rights:</strong> Right to freedom of speech, religion, assembly, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Rights:</strong> Right to vote, contest elections, form parties.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Rights:</strong> Right to work, fair wages, own property, social security.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Theories of Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Natural Theory:</strong> Rights are universal and inherent, not created by the state.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Theory:</strong> Rights are created and protected by the laws of the state.</li>
    <li><strong>Historical Theory:</strong> Rights evolve from customs and historical practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Social Welfare Theory:</strong> Rights promote social welfare and collective good.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Rights and Duties</h2>
  <p>
    Rights and duties are two sides of the same coin. Every right implies a corresponding duty. For example, the right to freedom 
    of speech carries the duty not to spread hate. Citizens must exercise their rights responsibly and respect the rights of others.
  </p>

  <h2>Fundamental Rights in the Indian Constitution</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Article 14–18:</strong> Right to Equality</li>
    <li><strong>Article 19–22:</strong> Right to Freedom</li>
    <li><strong>Article 23–24:</strong> Right against Exploitation</li>
    <li><strong>Article 25–28:</strong> Right to Freedom of Religion</li>
    <li><strong>Article 29–30:</strong> Cultural and Educational Rights</li>
    <li><strong>Article 32:</strong> Right to Constitutional Remedies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Importance of Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure individual freedom and dignity</li>
    <li>Promote equality and social justice</li>
    <li>Strengthen democracy by empowering citizens</li>
    <li>Protect minorities and vulnerable groups</li>
    <li>Prevent abuse of power by authorities</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges to Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>State censorship and misuse of laws</li>
    <li>Social discrimination and inequality</li>
    <li>Suppression of dissent and political opposition</li>
    <li>Economic exploitation and lack of access to justice</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Rights are essential for a just and humane society. They are not gifts from the state but are necessary for individuals 
    to develop their full potential. A democratic society must continuously protect and expand rights while ensuring their 
    responsible use through civic education and legal safeguards.
