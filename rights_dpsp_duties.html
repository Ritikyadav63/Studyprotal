  <h1>Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles of State Policy & Fundamental Duties</h1>

  <h2>1. Fundamental Rights (Part III, Articles 12–35)</h2>
  <p>
    Fundamental Rights are essential for the development of individuals and democracy. They are enforceable by the courts and protect citizens from arbitrary actions of the state.
  </p>

  <h3>Types of Fundamental Rights:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Right to Equality (Articles 14–18):</strong> Equality before the law, prohibition of discrimination, and abolition of untouchability and titles.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Freedom (Articles 19–22):</strong> Freedom of speech, assembly, association, movement, residence, and profession; protection in respect of conviction and arrest.</li>
    <li><strong>Right against Exploitation (Articles 23–24):</strong> Prohibition of human trafficking and child labor.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25–28):</strong> Freedom of conscience and practice, profession, and propagation of religion.</li>
    <li><strong>Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29–30):</strong> Protection of interests of minorities and right to establish and administer educational institutions.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Constitutional Remedies (Article 32):</strong> Right to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of Fundamental Rights (called the "heart and soul" of the Constitution by Dr. Ambedkar).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>2. Directive Principles of State Policy (Part IV, Articles 36–51)</h2>
  <p>
    DPSPs are guidelines for the state to establish a just society. They are non-justiciable but fundamental in governance.
  </p>

  <h3>Key Directives:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Promote welfare of the people (Art. 38).</li>
    <li>Ensure equal pay for equal work (Art. 39).</li>
    <li>Provide free legal aid (Art. 39A).</li>
    <li>Promote education and health (Art. 41–47).</li>
    <li>Improve environment and protect forests (Art. 48A).</li>
    <li>Organize village panchayats (Art. 40).</li>
    <li>Promote international peace and security (Art. 51).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Though not enforceable, many DPSPs have been implemented through laws and policies, e.g., Right to Education Act.</p>

  <h2>3. Fundamental Duties (Part IVA, Article 51A)</h2>
  <p>
    Fundamental Duties were added by the 42nd Amendment Act, 1976, based on the Soviet model. They act as moral obligations for citizens to uphold national values.
  </p>

  <h3>List of Fundamental Duties:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions.</li>
    <li>Cherish noble ideals of freedom struggle.</li>
    <li>Uphold sovereignty, unity, and integrity of India.</li>
    <li>Defend the country and render national service.</li>
    <li>Promote harmony and common brotherhood.</li>
    <li>Value and preserve the rich heritage of our culture.</li>
    <li>Protect and improve the natural environment.</li>
    <li>Develop scientific temper, humanism, and spirit of inquiry.</li>
    <li>Safeguard public property and abjure violence.</li>
    <li>Strive for excellence in all spheres of activity.</li>
    <li>(Added by 86th Amendment) Ensure educational opportunities for children between 6 and 14 years.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Fundamental Rights, DPSPs, and Fundamental Duties together form the core of the Indian constitutional philosophy—balancing individual freedom, state responsibility, and citizen duties for the welfare of society.
