  <h1>Justice – Meaning, Types, and Importance</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Justice is a core value of political theory and the foundation of a fair society. It ensures that individuals receive 
    what they are due—whether rights, opportunities, or resources—and that power is exercised in a fair, impartial manner.
  </p>

  <h2>Definitions by Thinkers</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Plato:</strong> "Justice is doing one’s own work and not meddling with what isn’t one’s own."</li>
    <li><strong>Aristotle:</strong> "Justice is giving to each their due, and treating equals equally and unequals unequally."</li>
    <li><strong>Rawls:</strong> "Justice is fairness, especially in the distribution of primary goods."</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Types of Justice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social Justice:</strong> Ensures equal access to wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Justice:</strong> Fair distribution of resources, equal pay for equal work, and welfare measures for the poor.</li>
    <li><strong>Political Justice:</strong> Equal political rights, participation in governance, and protection of civil liberties.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Justice:</strong> Equal treatment under the law, independent judiciary, and protection of legal rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Theories of Justice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Platonic Theory:</strong> Justice is harmony in society; each class performing its function.</li>
    <li><strong>Aristotelian Theory:</strong> Justice is based on merit and desert; people get what they deserve.</li>
    <li><strong>Liberal Theory (Rawls):</strong> Justice as fairness; focus on equal liberty and benefit to the least advantaged.</li>
    <li><strong>Marxist Theory:</strong> Justice means the abolition of class distinctions and establishment of a classless society.</li>
    <li><strong>Utilitarian Theory:</strong> Justice is the greatest good of the greatest number.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Justice in the Indian Constitution</h2>
  <p>
    Justice is a key objective of the Indian Constitution, as declared in the Preamble:
    <strong>"Justice – Social, Economic and Political"</strong>. 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Social Justice:</strong> Reflected in Articles 15, 17 (abolition of untouchability), and affirmative action.</li>
    <li><strong>Economic Justice:</strong> Directive Principles (Article 39) aim to reduce wealth inequality.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Justice:</strong> Article 39A ensures equal justice and legal aid for all.</li>
    <li><strong>Judicial Interpretation:</strong> Courts have expanded the meaning of justice through landmark judgments.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Importance of Justice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Upholds the rule of law and democratic values</li>
    <li>Protects individual rights and liberties</li>
    <li>Promotes social harmony and reduces conflict</li>
    <li>Establishes trust in institutions and governance</li>
    <li>Ensures equal opportunity and fair treatment</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Justice vs. Equality</h2>
  <p>
    Justice goes beyond formal equality. While equality treats everyone the same, justice considers circumstances and ensures fair outcomes.
    For example, giving equal education to all is equality; giving extra support to disadvantaged students is justice.
  </p>

  <h2>Challenges to Justice</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Caste-based and gender discrimination</li>
    <li>Corruption and delay in legal processes</li>
    <li>Economic inequality and poverty</li>
    <li>Political misuse of power</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Justice is the moral and legal foundation of a civil society. A just society ensures that all individuals, regardless of 
    background, enjoy fairness, dignity, and rights. Justice must be actively upheld by the state, the judiciary, and citizens alike.
