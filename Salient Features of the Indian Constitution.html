  <h1>Salient Features of the Indian Constitution</h1>

  <h2>1. Lengthiest Written Constitution</h2>
  <p>
    The Indian Constitution is the longest written constitution in the world. It originally had 395 Articles, 22 Parts, and 8 Schedules. Today, it contains 470 Articles, 25 Parts, and 12 Schedules due to amendments.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Blend of Rigidity and Flexibility</h2>
  <p>
    The Constitution can be amended by a special majority (rigid) or a simple majority (flexible), depending on the nature of the amendment. This balance ensures both stability and adaptability.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Federal System with Unitary Bias</h2>
  <p>
    India has a quasi-federal system, where powers are divided between the Centre and the States. However, the Centre has overriding powers, especially during emergencies, making it unitary in nature.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Parliamentary Form of Government</h2>
  <p>
    The President is the constitutional head, while the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers exercise real power. This system ensures collective responsibility and accountability to the Parliament.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Fundamental Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Part III of the Constitution guarantees six fundamental rights to all citizens, such as the Right to Equality, Right to Freedom, and Right to Constitutional Remedies, promoting liberty and justice.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Directive Principles of State Policy</h2>
  <p>
    Enshrined in Part IV, these are non-justiciable guidelines to promote social and economic democracy. Inspired by the Irish Constitution, they aim to build a welfare state.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Secular State</h2>
  <p>
    India is a secular state with no official religion. The State treats all religions equally and provides freedom of religion to all citizens under Article 25 to 28.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Single Citizenship</h2>
  <p>
    Unlike federal countries like the USA, India provides single citizenship to all its citizens, ensuring national unity and integrity.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Independent Judiciary</h2>
  <p>
    The judiciary is free from executive control. The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power of judicial review to protect citizens’ rights and uphold the Constitution.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Universal Adult Franchise</h2>
  <p>
    Every citizen of India who is 18 years or older has the right to vote, without discrimination based on caste, religion, or gender.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Emergency Provisions</h2>
  <p>
    The Constitution provides for National, State, and Financial Emergencies under Articles 352, 356, and 360, allowing the Centre to assume more powers in times of crisis.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Special Provisions for Minorities and Backward Classes</h2>
  <p>
    The Constitution provides reservations in education, employment, and legislatures to uplift socially and educationally backward groups and protect minorities.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The Indian Constitution is a unique document that reflects India's diversity, democratic ethos, and commitment to justice and equality. Its salient features make it dynamic and responsive to the nation's evolving needs.
